# Hyperparameter-Tuning-with-Keras-Tuner
We will use an open source package "Keras Tuner" to find optimal hyperparamters for a Keras model. Keras Tuner along with Keras API can help machine learning practitioners automate Hyperparameter tuning tasks for their Keras models.

Objectives:

1. Learning to use Keras Tuner for hyperparameter tuning (we are not going to implement the tuning algorithms ourselves)
2. Creating Custom Tuners with Keras Tuner
3. Conducting Hyperparameter Tuning Experiments with Keras Tuner

Prior programming experience in Python and theoretical understanding of Neural Networks, and optimization algorithms like gradient descent is needed to follow this project. 


This implementation is a part of the course "Hyperparameter Tuning with Keras Tuner" from Coursera
